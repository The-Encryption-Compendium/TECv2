	url = {https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf},
	abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption
key. This has two important consequences:
1. Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a
message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by
the intended recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he
knows the corresponding decryption key.
2. A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone
can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny
the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic
mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems.
A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a
publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is
divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret prime numbers
p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where
e · d ≡ 1 (mod (p − 1) · (q − 1)). The security of the system rests in part on
the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

	abstract = {The recent decision by Apple and Google to enable encryption by default on new iPhones and Android smartphones, so that only the user can unlock his or her phone, has led to strong complaints from law enforcement agencies arguing that the move will deprive them of critical evidence. The Attorney General and the FBI Director have gone so far as to suggest that Congress may need to step in and tell companies to redesign their products, to ensure that government investigators can access encrypted data or wiretap online communications when they have appropriate legal authority like a search warrant. However, technologists and privacy advocates say that such a move would undermine the overall security of our data and devices while also putting US companies at a serious disadvantage in the global technology marketplace, and point to the fact that law enforcement and intelligence agencies already have access to more data about us, our communications, and our movements than at any other time in human history—a veritable “Golden Age” of surveillance. Which side is right?

Join New America for a lively debate on this timely technology policy issue, followed by a question and answer session with the audience. On one side: former FBI General Counsel Andrew Weissmann, arguing for law enforcement’s interests. On the other side: legal scholar and former White House technology policy czar Professor Peter Swire, arguing in favor of strong encryption without backdoors for the government. In between as moderator: Nancy Libin, former Chief Privacy and Civil Liberties Officer at the Justice Department. Hosted by Kevin Bankston, Policy Director of New America’s Open Technology Institute.},

	abstract = {As the 21st century approaches, encryption is presenting a national security dilemma in the US. While the use of strong encryption for computerized data is essential in protecting our nation, widespread, unregulated encryption poses serious problems on two levels: encryption could inhibit the government's ability to enforce the law as well as gather foreign intelligence. As a result, the government has established export controls on encryption products and proposed a 'key recovery' system designed to enable law enforcement officers to access encrypted data in the course of lawful investigations. The export controls have been ineffective and counterproductive policy and are arguably unconstitutional under the First Amendment. However, export controls are the only viable solution to the intelligence gathering problem and will need to survive these political and legal attacks or our national security could be jeopardized. Key recovery will be difficult and costly to implement and has come under attack by civil liberties' groups. Nevertheless, a cost-effective compromise on key recovery is necessary to meet the needs of law enforcement. Such a system, if it mirrored current electronic surveillance law, would effectively balance individual privacy rights and governmental interests and thus should survive constitutional scrutiny. Congress and President Clinton ought to enact key recovery legislation soon before the use of encryption becomes commonplace. A failure to act intelligently and effectively on this critical, cutting-edge issue could compromise our nation's future.},

@misc{eff_calea_2015,
	title = {{CALEA}},
	url = {https://www.eff.org/issues/calea},
	abstract = {The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) of 1994 Congress passed the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, which forced telephone companies to redesign their network architectures to make it easier for law enforcement to wiretap digital telephone calls. In 2005, CALEA was expanded by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to include Internet service providers (ISPs) and VoIP services like Skype. A few years later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began pushing legislation trying to expand CALEA to all online communications software. After an uproar, the proposal died quietly, but resurfaced in 2010, and again in 2013. In May of that year, the New York Times reported the White House as "on the verge" of backing the rumored FBI proposal. The newest proposal would not only expand CALEA to all online communications services, but would allow the FBI to fine noncompliant companies. Now, in 2014 the issue as at the forefront again, with the FBI calling for a national “discussion” about the use of encryption.  We expect the issue to continue to be front-page news for the foreseeable future. 2004: Expansion By the Federal Communications Commission For ten years CALEA only applied to telephone companies, but in 2004 the Department of Justice (DOJ), FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) filed a joint petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) asking it to expand CALEA to cover communications that travel over the Internet. Specifically, the petition requested CALEA apply to broadband providers, to VoIP communications, and to other kinds of instant messaging programs. EFF objected to a number of the requests in the joint petition in conjunction with numerous other organizations. Despite the objections, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) expanding CALEA to broadband Internet access providers and managed VoIP systems. After a yearlong rulemaking process, the FCC announced a Final Rule confirming the expansions in the NPRM. Congress explicitly exempted data traveling over the Internet in CALEA, but the FCC ruled that CALEA could be expanded to Internet broadband providers, like ISPs, and certain VoIP providers. As a result, EFF and a coalition of public interest, industry, and academic groups challenged the FCC's unjustified expansion in the DC circuit court. Despite Judge Harry Edwards declaring the FCC's argument "gobbedldygook," and "utter nonsense," the court approved the FCC's expansion. 2010: Give the Government an Inch of CALEA and It Will Take a Mile of Your Privacy In 2010, the FBI began its "Going Dark" campaign. Despite the fact that we are in a Golden Age of Surveillance, the campaign is a charm offensive to convince politicians that FBI is unable to listen in on Internet users' digital communications after obtaining a court order because of recent advances in technology. The proposed legislation would have forced all communications services to build secret backdoors for the government to spy on users and to decrypt any encrypted messages exchanged via the service. The proposal's problems were many, and it quietly died after a tremendous amount of uproar. Shortly after the 2010 proposal, EFF filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against three agencies of the Department of Justice (DOJ) demanding records that would justify the Administration’s need to expand federal surveillance laws like CALEA. Within a year, EFF received only a few hundred documents out of the thousands the DOJ said it possessed. It's been three years, and the DOJ has continued to stall the release of the entire records. 2013 and Onwards In the beginning of 2013, it was reported the FBI was again pushing for a wholesale expansion of CALEA to all Internet communications services. Similar to 2010, the FBI wants to force all companies with messaging services to engineer their products with a secret government backdoor and to decrypt all encrypted messages. The proposal also adds another component: fining companies for not cooperating. In May 2013, the New York Times revealed that the White House was "on the verge" of backing the proposal. While the bill was not introduced in 2013, updating CALEA was a stated priority for FBI Director James Comey in 2014 and we expect it to be so for 2015 as well. CALEA Must Not Be Expanded The 2013 proposal is a tremendous blow to security and privacy. The FBI already has an unprecedented level of access to our communications and personal data; access which it regularly uses. And we’ve seen government mandated backdoors—so-called CALEA interfaces—being used by criminals as the point-and-click wiretapping that they are. In an age where the government claims to want to beef up Internet security, any backdoors into our communications makes our infrastructure weaker. Any government mandate that communications software or services include backdoors will take away not only developers' right to innovate, but also average users' right to protect their privacy and speak anonymously through the technologies of their choice. In the United States, those rights are unambiguously protected by the First Amendment. We have the right to engage in private conversations online, just as we have the right to private conversations in person, and those rights must be protected.},

@article{baranetsky_encryption_2017,
	title = {{ENCRYPTION} {AND} {THE} {PRESS} {CLAUSE}},
	volume = {6},
	abstract = {Almost twenty years ago, a hostile debate over whether government could regulate encryption—later named the Crypto Wars—seized the country. At the center of this debate stirred one simple question: is encryption protected speech? This issue touched all branches of government percolating from Congress, to the President, and eventually to the federal courts. In a waterfall of cases, several United States Court of Appeals appeared to reach a consensus that encryption was protected speech under the First Amendment, and with that the Crypto Wars appeared to be over, until now.
Nearly twenty years later, the Crypto Wars have returned. Following recent mass shootings, law enforcement has once again questioned the legal protection for encryption and tried to implement “backdoor” techniques to access messages sent over encrypted channels. In the case, Apple v. FBI, the agency tried to compel Apple to grant access to the iPhone of a San Bernardino shooter. The case was never decided, but the legal arguments briefed before the court were essentially the same as they were two decades prior. Apple and amici supporting the company argued that encryption was protected speech.
While these arguments remain convincing, circumstances have changed in ways that should be reflected in the legal doctrines that lawyers use. Unlike twenty years ago, today surveillance is ubiquitous, and the need for encryption is no longer felt by a seldom few. Encryption has become necessary for even the most basic exchange of information given that most Americans share “nearly every aspect of
their lives—from the mundane to the intimate” over the Internet, as stated in a recent Supreme Court opinion.1
Given these developments, lawyers might consider a new justification under the Press Clause. In addition to the many doctrinal concerns that exist with protection under the Speech Clause, the Press Clause is normatively and descriptively more accurate at protecting encryption as a tool for secure communication without fear of government surveillance. This Article outlines that framework by examining the historical and theoretical transformation of the Press Clause since its inception.},

When the Court rules, the original understanding of the Fifth Amendment may control the outcome. This Article details an extraordinary case that illuminates the original understanding of the privilege and its application to compelled decryption. During the 1807 treason trial of Aaron Burr, with Chief Justice John Marshall presiding, the government asked Burr’s private secretary if he knew the cipher to an encrypted letter Burr had sent to a co-conspirator. Burr’s secretary pled the Fifth, leading to an extensive debate on the meaning of the privilege and an opinion from the Chief Justice.The Burr dispute presents a remarkable opportunity to unearth the original understanding of the Fifth Amendment and its application to surprisingly modern facts. The lawyers in Burr were celebrated and experienced advocates. The Chief Justice allowed them to argue the Fifth Amendment question in exhaustive detail. And an attorney recorded the entire argument in shorthand, including dozens of legal citations to the specific pages of the authorities the lawyers invoked. The rich materials allow us to reconstruct for the first time precisely how the privilege was understood by leading lawyers and Chief Justice John Marshall soon after the Fifth Amendment’s ratification. The Article presents that reconstruction, and it concludes by applying Burr’s lessons to the modern problem of compelled decryption of digital devices such as cell phones and computers.},

In September 2017, Access Now, supported by the Mozilla Foundation’s Tech Policy Fellowship, hosted the Crypto Colloquium — an invite-only dialogue, with participation under the Chatham House rules — to discuss this challenge. Participants represented four stakeholder groups: civil society, academic experts, technology companies, and former U.S. government officials.

The discussion began with the assumption that it is technically possible to build mechanisms that allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies access to the material on encrypted devices without the user’s assistance.

The Crypto Colloquium was a discussion of the legal, security, and economic consequences of mandating this type of mechanism in order to ensure government access to content information on devices. The conversations overlapped in several meaningful ways, producing
important observations that the participants largely agreed upon, although not necessarily unanimously.

In this report we provide a summary of the lessons learned, as well as some more general “unanswered questions” that participants identified as needing more research and analysis. The report begins with a history of the debate over encryption and description of the methodology for the Crypto Colloquium.},

	abstract = {In 1993, the US Government proposed a novel (and highly controversial) approach to cryptography, called key escrow. Key escrow cryptosystems used standard symmetric- and public- key ciphers, key management techniques and protocols, but with one added feature: a copy of the current session key, itself encrypted with a key known to the government, was sent at the beginning of every encrypted communication stream. In this way, if a government wiretapper encountered ciphertext produced under a key escrowed cryptosystem, recovering the plaintext would be a simple matter of decrypting the session key with the government’s key, regardless of the strength of the underlying cipher algorithms. Key escrow was intended to strike a “balance” between the needs for eﬀective communications security against bad guys on the one hand and the occasional need for the good guys to be able to recover meaningful content from (presumably) legally-authorized wiretaps.},

	abstract = {It has been over a year since The Guardian reported the first story on the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs based on the leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, yet the national conversation remains largely mired in a simplistic debate over the tradeoffs between national security and individual privacy. It is time to start weighing the overall costs and benefits more broadly. While intelligence officials have vigorously defended the merits of the NSA programs, they have offered little hard evidence to prove their value—and some of the initial analysis actually suggests that the benefits of these programs are dubious. Three different studies—from the President’s Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and the New America Foundation’s International Security Program—question the value of bulk collection programs in stopping terrorist plots and enhancing national security. Meanwhile, there has been little sustained discussion of the costs of the NSA programs beyond their impact on privacy and liberty, and in particular, how they affect the U.S. economy, American foreign policy, and the security of the Internet as a whole.

This paper attempts to quantify and categorize the costs of the NSA surveillance programs since the initial leaks were reported in June 2013. Our findings indicate that the NSA’s actions have already begun to, and will continue to, cause significant damage to the interests of the United States and the global Internet community.},

It describes how the decision by the European Union (EU) Council of Ministers on 22 June 2000, to create a license free zone for exports of encryption (and other) items (referred to herein as the “EU Regulations”) provided the initial stimulus for these changes. It also describes how the US Regulations fall short of matching the EU Regulations in some respects, while exceeding the EU Regulations in other respects. In addition, the authors offer recommendations for further reforms to the US encryption export control policy that might be addressed by the next administration in Washington. They conclude on a cautionary note, considering the possibility that the recent reforms to US encryption export control policy could be reversed in the future.},

	abstract = {With everyday transactions now being carried out electronically, people need to trust that their private communications are not intercepted or altered as they make their way across global networks. Encryption is currently the only reliable means of securing the confidentiality of such communications and can help citizens and businesses defend themselves against fraud, electronic vandalism and the improper disclosure of confidential information. However, because of its unique ability to conceal data, encryption may also be deployed for illegitimate purposes. This prospect has urged law enforcement agencies and governments to call for restrictions on its use and development. Privacy advocates and business interest groups resist any attempts to limit encryption arguing that to do so would unfairly compromise the privacy of individuals and jeopardise the development of electronic commerce. This paper looks at the tension between the two sides to this heated debate and studies how law makers in the US and Europe have chosen to meet the challenge of regulating this area.},

If large-scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.},

	abstract = {Encryption is essential to Australia’s modern
digital society, economy, and cyber security,
and it is only effective if it is strong and robust.

Strong encryption serves Australia’s national
interests by protecting governments,
communities, and the economy from criminal,
terrorist, and state-sponsored attacks.

Encryption will only become more important for
protecting Australian interests as technology
advances in the coming decades.

The government is proposing to weaken encryption
in the name of fighting terrorism, however this policy
would create more security risks than it addresses.

There are other policy options for dealing with
terrorist use of digital technology that are more
urgent and effective than weakening encryption.},
